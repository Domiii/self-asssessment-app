### Research TODO
* Produce rules for self-evaluating whether we know non-concrete answers or not
* Estimate size of a question in the "learning space" relative to one another (broader, more general questions are bigger than more specific questions)
* Estimate size of entire "learning space"


### Done
* CRUD concepts + concept questions
* Implement original prototype: http://codepen.io/Domiii/pen/MbGLxJ
* Implement generalized Firebase interface and corresponding utilities (see `src/util/firebaseUtil`)
* Add bootstrap + react-bootstrap
* Implement redux-act: https://github.com/pauldijou/redux-act/blob/master/examples/todomvc/reducers/todos.js
