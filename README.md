# Simple Self-Assessment App
Built with React, Redux, Firebase and based on [todo-react-redux](https://github.com/r-park/todo-react-redux).

A version of this app built with [redux-saga middleware](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga) is available [here](https://github.com/r-park/todo-redux-saga).

## TODO
* Re-implement using bootstrap + react-bootstrap
* Change permissions: let "admin" (and only "admin") see all TODOs
* Re-implement original prototype: http://codepen.io/Domiii/pen/MbGLxJ
* Add persistance: store data using Firebase
