# Simple Self-Assessment App
Built with React, Redux, Firebase and based on [todo-react-redux](https://github.com/r-park/todo-react-redux).


### TODO
* Implement redux-act: https://github.com/pauldijou/redux-act/blob/master/examples/todomvc/reducers/todos.js
* Implement generalized Firebase interface
* Re-implement original prototype: http://codepen.io/Domiii/pen/MbGLxJ
* Convert question data to new format (and keep as separate file)
* Store responses in FB
* Visualize responses of each individual Question
* ResponseSummary
* Teacher view: Pick a user from list of all users and check their responses with options: [OverEstimated, UnderEstimated, JustRight]
* Filter: Finished, Unfinished, Untried
* Filters: Checkboxes of response types
* Ordering: Random
* Store question data in FB

### Research TODO
* Produce rules for self-evaluating whether we know non-concrete answers or not
* Estimate size of a question in the "learning space" relative to one another (broader, more general questions are bigger than more specific questions)
* Estimate size of entire "learning space"


### Done
* Add bootstrap + react-bootstrap
