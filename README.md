logUIEvents

```json
[
  uid,
  uiActionName,     // [UserIsBack, UserIdle, ApplicationFocusLost]
  args
]
```

### Research TODO
* Produce rules for self-evaluating whether we know non-concrete answers or not
* Estimate size of a question in the "learning space" relative to one another (broader, more general questions are bigger than more specific questions)
* Estimate size of entire "learning space"
