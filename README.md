## TODO
* migrate to https://github.com/prescottprue/react-redux-firebase
** http://react-redux-firebase.com/docs/populate

* layout: change layout of "done" items: background = grey-ish, change button color (red -> green)
* bug: Safari layouting is broken!!!!
* bug: percentage summation is broken
* safety switch: Don't be able to delete concepts that have children
* safety switch: Don't display trash can when adding stuff

* Notifications
** create a parameter -> path mapping for notification-related data
** create a batch request for all notification-related data, possibly using simpler syntax
** render notifications properly

* Better submission + progress overview
** need submission progress bar
** need single (admin-only?) view over everyone's current submission status (of a specific concept + child concepts)

* feedback system
** teacher/admin can give written feedback on all submissions
** add submission feedback page route
** add notification for feedback entry
** can see all feedback given to self on one page

* submission progress bar
** three-colored bar: A x (not done), B x (submitted + unchecked), C x (submitted + checked)

* better submission system + advanced response (not just vanilla text)
** simple YSIWYG MD editor
** add new symbols to markdown: link, google drive/slides, youtube video, scratch project (can easily choose: embed mode and/or code)

* Will need test database anytime soon...

* User "groups"
** Used to limit what activity other users see

* stats + "evaluation system"
** Visualize data and evaluate first results, after Wed class
** See stats/comparisons related to every concept/conceptCheck?

* all kinds of small things
** Navigation: Add "left" , "right" + "up" buttons to quickly navigate to previous and next siblings, and parent
** Editor: Add "move up" + "move down" buttons to child concepts edit tools (changes order)
** Add preview to concept display + editor
** Move editor save button to the top

* User overview
** See all users

* notification system

* Add buttons to evaluate a concept: good/bad/requests/"add to short list"?

* Add optional written feedback option to concept check response (automatically opens up when selecting report-type checks)
* make the interface more exploratory
** Hide advanced concepts
** Boss level unlocks advanced concepts

* Test new users + un-privileged users
* bug: Safari layouting is broken!!!!

* Data cleaning + verification: Add methods to view + easily remove duplicate children on pre-defined indices


## More TODO
* bug: move ensureUserInitialized to componentWillMount, use onAuthStateChanged event
* bug: language buttons appear only after user is updated the first time?
* bug: Scratch embed craps out?
* firebase rule replacer utility: make it nice and easy to write aliases for rule checks
* firebase index validation utility: make it nice and easy to check/verify/update all indices through commandline
* firebase cache validation utility: make it nice and easy to check/verify/update all kinds of cached info through commandline
* Add system for "check progress caching", reduce load requirements
* Add auto-screenshot preview feature (use [html2canvas](http://html2canvas.hertzen.com/examples.html))
* Show orphaned concepts, checks and other orphaned data
* Add Google Slides to markdown
* Versioning system (disable most of client functionality when client and DB version don't match)
* Notifications
* Groups + Grouping
* More Submission features
** Backend for viewing, checking off and working with submissions
** Peer assessment

* Data refactoring
** separate progress updates from other check responses, separate into different paths, instead of using `selected` child
** change checkResponse key to match `uid_checkId` index

* Filter: Finished, Unfinished, Untried
* Filters: Checkboxes of response types
* Display statistics
* Add 小筆記 feature
* Activity logging
* Fancy features
** Handle invalid urls + 404s properly

### Research TODO
* Produce rules for self-evaluating whether we know non-concrete answers or not
* Estimate size of a question in the "learning space" relative to one another (broader, more general questions are bigger than more specific questions)
* Estimate size of entire "learning space"
